## Authentication Mechanisms

Authentication of the clients will be handled with session tokens, a-la CS240. 

### Registration / Login Process
The user will provide a username and a password on the login screen. 
They will then select either "Register" or "Login", and they will be informed 
of any errors (username taken, incorrect login). The server will respond with
either an auth token or an error message.

### Format
The token will be some string randomly generated by the server. After receiving
the token, the client must include it in every subsequent request made to the
server (ie the only open endpoint is the `/register` endpoint) with the 
`Authorization` header. 

This header is used to determine which user made the request and which commands 
should be sent.
