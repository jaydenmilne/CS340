## Authentication Mechanisms

Authentication of the clients will be handled with session tokens, a-la CS240. 

### Registration / Login Process
The user will provide a username and a password on the login screen. 

- If that username has been registered and the password does not match the server's hash, the user will be informed that password is incorrect. 
- If the username has not been registered, the server will register that user and save a hash of the password, returning a temporary session token that must be included in every subsequent request. 
- If the username is registered and the password matches the hash, the server will issue an authentication token

### Format
The token will be some string randomly generated by the server. After receiving the token, the client must include it in every subsequent request made to the server (ie the only open endpoint is the `/register` endpoint) with the `Authorization` header. 

This header is used to determine which user made the request and which commands should be sent.
